Keoagile holds a PhD in bioinformatics. He is currently a researcher, and an interim Marine Microbiomics SARChI Chair. His research involves using evolutionary genomics to study gene exchange events and microevolutionary processes that shape microbial communities in their natural habitats. This includes discovering novel prokaryotic and eukaryotic viruses and how these may influence microbiome structures and biogeochemical cycles using sequence data. His previous and ongoing research has involved work in different systems ranging from the ocean, freshwater, the human gut, and terrestrial ecosystems. He employs meta-omics (metagenomics, single-cell genomics, and phylogenomics) to fully explore the evolution and ecological roles of the microbiome from a community to a single-cell level.
